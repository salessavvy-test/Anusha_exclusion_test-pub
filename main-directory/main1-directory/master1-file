Even over here, captain Rohit Sharma has followed the same pattern, showing the aggressive intent straightaway. A 47-ball 58 and 44-ball 64 from Rohit has allowed India to breeze at seven-plus runs per over in the first powerplay. Thereafter, despite needing only 4.25 runs per over, the middle-order has faltered and were unable to get the better of Lankan spinners.

However in these conditions, Sri Lanka – who have not even qualified for next year’s Champions Trophy – have outsmarted India. In both these matches, India’s spinners have been as economical, if not better, as their Lankan counterparts. But where Sri Lanka have done better is how they have gone after the Indian quicks in the last 10 overs, even spinners to an extent. The 65 and 79 runs that they accumulated in the last powerplay had been the big difference.
